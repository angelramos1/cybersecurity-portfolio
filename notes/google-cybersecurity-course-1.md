### Phishing Detection
- **Technical Indicators** (Priority): Incorrect sender domains, malicious link addresses
- **Content Indicators**: Poor grammar, misspellings, generic greetings, unusual requests

### Important Terms
- **Compliance**: Process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations
- **Security Frameworks**: Guidelines for building plans to mitigate risks and threats
- **Security Controls**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks
- **Security Posture**: Organization's ability to manage defense of critical assets and react to change
- **Network Security**: Practice of keeping network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access
- **Cloud Security**: Ensuring cloud assets are properly configured with limited access

## Module 2: Security Threats and Actors

### Attack Evolution
- Historical attacks: Brain Virus, Morris Worm, LoveLetter Attack, Equifax Breach
- **Social Engineering**: Manipulation technique exploiting human error to gain private information

### Phishing Types
- **BEC (Business Email Compromise)**: Email from apparent known source requesting information
- **Spear Phishing**: Targeted attack on specific users/groups
- **Whaling**: Spear phishing targeting executives
- **Vishing**: Voice communication exploitation
- **Smishing**: Text message-based attacks

### Malware Types
- **Viruses**: Require user initiation, hide in files
- **Worms**: Self-replicate across networks without user action
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts data and demands payment
- **Spyware**: Gathers and sells information without consent

### Social Engineering Tactics
- Authority, Intimidation, Consensus/Social proof, Scarcity, Familiarity, Trust, Urgency

### CISSP Eight Security Domains
1. **Security and Risk Management**: Security goals, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity
2. **Asset Security**: Digital and physical asset protection, data lifecycle management
3. **Security Architecture and Engineering**: Effective tools, systems, and processes
4. **Communication and Network Security**: Managing physical networks and wireless communications
5. **Identity and Access Management**: Controlling access to physical and logical assets
6. **Security Assessment and Testing**: Security audits, data collection and analysis
7. **Security Operations**: Investigations and preventative measures
8. **Software Development Security**: Secure coding practices

### Threat Actor Types
- **APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)**: Highly skilled, target critical infrastructure or intellectual property
- **Insider Threats**: Abuse authorized access for sabotage, corruption, espionage
- **Hacktivists**: Driven by political agenda

### Hacker Categories
- **Authorized (Ethical)**: Follow code of ethics, conduct risk evaluations
- **Semi-authorized (Researchers)**: Find vulnerabilities but don't exploit them
- **Unauthorized (Unethical)**: Malicious actors who don't respect the law

## Module 3: Security Frameworks and Controls

### CIA Triad
Foundation model for organizational security:
- **Confidentiality**: Only authorized users access specific assets
- **Integrity**: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable
- **Availability**: Data accessible to authorized users

### NIST Frameworks
- **NIST CSF**: Voluntary framework with standards, guidelines, and best practices
- **NIST RMF**: Risk management framework

### Key Regulations and Standards
- **FERC-NERC**: For organizations working with electricity/power grid
- **FedRAMP**: Standardizes security for cloud services in government
- **CIS**: Provides controls to safeguard systems and networks
- **GDPR**: EU regulation protecting data processing and privacy rights (72-hour breach notification)
- **PCI DSS**: International standard for credit card information security
- **HIPAA**: US law protecting patient health information (PHI)
- **ISO**: International standards for technology, manufacturing, and management
- **SOC 1/SOC 2**: Reports focusing on user access policies and financial compliance

### Security Ethics
**Ethical Principles**:
- Confidentiality
- Privacy protections
- Laws compliance

**Key Points**:
- Counterattacks are illegal in the US (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act)
- Only federal government/military personnel can counterattack
- Security professionals must remain unbiased and protect private data
- Obligation to safeguard PII and SPII data

**Types of Personal Data**:
- **PII**: Information inferring individual's identity (name, phone)
- **SPII**: Stricter handling required (SSN, credit card numbers)
- **PHI**: Protected health information under HIPAA

## Module 4: Security Tools and Technologies

### SIEM Tools
**Security Information and Event Management**: Applications that collect and analyze log data

**Common SIEM Tools**:
- **Splunk Enterprise**: Self-hosted, data retention and analysis
- **Chronicle**: Cloud-native, fast feature delivery

### Essential Security Tools
- **Playbooks**: Manuals providing operational action details for incident handling
- **Network Protocol Analyzers** (Packet Sniffers): Capture and analyze network traffic (tcpdump, Wireshark)
- **Antivirus Software**: Prevents, detects, and eliminates malware
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**: Monitors system activity and alerts on intrusions

### Key Playbook Types
- **Chain of Custody**: Documents evidence possession during incident lifecycle
- **Protecting and Preserving Evidence**: Handles volatile digital evidence using order of volatility

### Important Technologies

**Linux**:
- Open-source operating system
- Command-line interface primary
- Used for examining logs and system investigation

**SQL (Structured Query Language)**:
- Creates, interacts with, and requests information from databases
- Filters through large datasets

**Python**:
- Automates repetitive, time-consuming tasks
- Reduces human error through automation

**Encryption**:
- Converts plaintext into secure ciphertext
- Ensures confidentiality of private data

**Penetration Testing**:
- Simulated attacks identifying vulnerabilities
- Evaluates external and internal threats

## Key Takeaways
- Most cybersecurity work is learned on the job
- Security analysts must stay current with frameworks, controls, and compliance
- Ethics play a crucial role in daily security work
- Proactive security measures (audits, log reviews, compliance checks) prevent issues before exploitation
- Blue team defends, red team tests defenses
