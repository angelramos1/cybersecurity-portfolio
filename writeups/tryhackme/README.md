## Completed Rooms

### Introduction to Cyber Security Path

**[Offensive Security Intro](offensive-security-intro.md)**  
**Date:** January 26, 2026 | **Difficulty:** Easy  
First hands-on experience with offensive security. Used DirBuster (`dirb`) to enumerate hidden directories on a vulnerable web application and discovered security misconfigurations.

**Skills:** Web enumeration, directory brute-forcing, security misconfiguration identification

---

**[Defensive Security Intro](defensive-security-intro.md)**  
**Date:** January 26, 2026 | **Difficulty:** Easy  
Introduction to blue team operations. Learned about SOC operations, SIEM systems, and incident response. Practiced blocking malicious IP addresses to defend against active attacks.

**Skills:** Threat monitoring, incident response, SOC operations, defensive security fundamentals

## Key Takeaways So Far

**Offensive vs Defensive Security:**
- **Red Team (Offensive):** Finds vulnerabilities by thinking like an attacker
- **Blue Team (Defensive):** Protects systems by detecting and responding to threats
- Both perspectives complement each other and are essential for comprehensive security

**Tools Practiced:**
- DirBuster/dirb (directory enumeration)
- Security monitoring tools
- IP blocking mechanisms

**Concepts Learned:**
- Web application enumeration
- Security misconfigurations
- SOC operations and roles
- SIEM systems
- Incident response procedures
- Threat intelligence
